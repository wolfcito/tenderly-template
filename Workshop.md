# Staging in Web3 Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Virtual TestNets. More specifically:

- How to use Unlimited faucet to gain arbitrary amounts of tokens and native balances
- How to deploy Hardhat contracts to a Virtual TestNet
- How to stage smart contracts
- How to stage dapp UI
- How to create a Github action that will stage your smart contracts

## Act 1: Warmup

1. **Create a TestNet**
   ![testnet-creation.png](testnet-creation.png)
2. Add the network to MetaMask
3. Copy the address from MetaMask and fund it by going to **Unlimited Faucet** in Dashboard

## Act 2: Preparation

1. **Configure Hardhat**
    - Copy the correct snippet from Tenderly Dashboard **Virtual TestNets > Integrate**
    - Edit `packages/tenderly/tenderly.config.ts` and paste the copied object to `virtualNetworks.virtual_mainnet`
      entry.
    - Run `cd packages/tenderly && npm stage:connect hardhat && npm stage:connect nextjs`.

This will create configuration files referencing the given Virtual TestNet from `packages/hardhat`
and `packages/nextjs`.

2. Deploy contracts

Run the following command

```bash
cd packages/hardhat
rm -r deployments/virtual_mainnet
npx hardhat deploy --network virtual_mainnet
```

The file `nextjs/tenderly.config.ts`, containing chain configuration.

3. Interact

Run your NextJs server.

```bash
cd packages/tenderly
npm run connect:nextjs
cd packages/nextjs
npm run start
```

- Pick the **Burner Wallet**
- Click ðŸ’µ Faucet button
- Reload the page (because the funds are already there)

## Intermezzo: Verification, of course

It's almost fully set up. Do the following:

- Install [Tenderly CLI](https://github.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), then
  run `tenderly login` and follow the instructions

## Full setup instructions (skip)

To set up verification, here are the steps:

- Install [Tenderly CLI](https://github.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), then
  run `tenderly login` and follow the instructions
- Run `cd packages/hardhat && yarn add @tenderly/hardhat-tenderly`
- From **Virtual TestNets > Integrate** page, copy the first (`import`
  and `tenderly.setup({ automaticVerifications: true })`) and the third
  snippet (`username, project`) and update `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` accordingly.

- Re-Deploy and do something to your contract (Act 2, steps 2-4)
- Open the latest transaction. What do you see?

For more details, see
the [verification docs](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/develop/deploy-contracts#deploy-contracts-using-hardhat).

## Act 3: The Stage

But how can you get a fresh TestNet on demand?

- Run `npm run stage:new local` to get a new Virtual TestNet you can use to set up a new staging environment
- Run `npm run stage:activate local` to make this environment active
- Run `npm run stage:connect nextjs && npm run stage:connect hardhat` to link next.js and hardhat with the active
  environment

After this, your Next.js and hardhat projects are configured to talk to the newly created testnet.

## Act 5: Build

This is nice, but how to do it in the cloud?

1. Create the file `.github/workflows/stage-dapp.yaml`
   your [Dapp Staging Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)  (see the yaml below)
2. Configure your github action with the following **environment variables**:
3. Configure your github action with the following **secrets**:
   `TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_ID`
   and `TENDERLY_PROJECT_ID` ([guide](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/account-project-slug))
   `TENDERLY_ACCESS_TOKEN` ([guide](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/how-to-generate-api-access-token)).
